Hi, I'm Katherine Cox-Buday, and this is probably the best way to reach anything I do.

I am the author of the book, "[[http://katherine.cox-buday.com/concurrency-in-go][Concurrency in Go]]", and a computer scientist currently working at [[https://www.simple.com/][Simple]]. My hobbies include software engineering, creative writing, Go (igo, baduk, weiquei), and music, all of which I pursue intermittently and with various levels of dedication.

I am a practicing Buddhist, and I am currently exploring the [[http://secularbuddhism.org/][secular]] school of thought. Above all, I wish peace and happiness to all people, and -- by extension -- to you :)
