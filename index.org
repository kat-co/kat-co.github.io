Hi, I'm Katherine Cox-Buday, and this is probably the best way to reach anything I do.

I am a computer scientist currently working at [[http://www.canonical.com/][Canonical]] (of [[http://www.ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]] fame) on [[https://jujucharms.com/][Juju]], a cloud orchestration system. My hobbies include software engineering, creative writing, Go (igo, baduk, weiquei), and guitar, all of which I pursue intermittently and with various levels of dedication.

I am a practicing Buddhist, and I am currently exploring the [[http://secularbuddhism.org/][secular]] school of thought. Above all, I wish peace and happiness to all people, and -- by extension -- to you :)

* Charities I Support

Charity is important to me. Here are the charities I'm currently focusing on:

- NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness)
- HRC (The Human Rights Campaign)
- WWF (World Wildlife Fund)
- Wikimedia Foundation (Wikipedia)
- Girls Who Code

* Elsewhere                                                        :noexport:

By day I work on Juju, an awesome open source cloud-orchestartion system. It's written in Go, and I spend my entire day around smart people. It's fantastic.

Most (but not all) of my work is here. The work that isn't isn't worth seeing.

I don't usually post things here; it's mostly for following others.
